# Absenteeism at Work Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **number of hours an employee is absent from work** using machine learning techniques.
It is an HR analytics use case aimed at improving workforce planning, productivity analysis, and absenteeism management.

The project was developed as part of an academic/certification requirement and follows standard data science and machine learning practices.
